                    <h1>Concept</h1>                        
                    <p>
                        By using compliant motion planning and an accurate wall-following algorithm, we can consistently locate the target door within a relatively small error. (less than the width of the door) This is an improvement over attempting to reach the door using dead-reckoning.
                    </p>  

                    <h1>Algorithm Overview</h1>                        
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Localize position using the pillar as a reference point</p></li>
                        <li><p>Localize orientation using the pillar as a reference point</p></li>
                        <li><p>Drive to the main wall of Harris</p></li>
                        <li><p>Follow the wall for a known distance in order to reach the door</p></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>Localizing Position</h1>                        
                    <p>
                        The robot moves out up to 30cm in four directions in an attempt to find the pillar. Once a bump is detected, it moves to the next stage.
                    </p>  

                    <h1>Localizing Orientation</h1>                        
                    <p>
                        Now that the wall has been found, the robot spins in a circle, using the wall sensor to detect when it has come close to a 90° angle with the pillar. It then spins an additional 10 degrees to account for the fact that the wall sensor triggers a coupe of degrees early, and to help ensure that error in the rotation doesn't cause the robot to run into the pillar.
                    </p>  

                    <h1>Reaching the Main Wall</h1>                        
                    <p>
                        In this stage, the robot simply drives forward until it detects a bump. Then it turns 90° to the left and moves to the next stage. 
                    </p>  

                    <h1>Following the Wall a Known Distance</h1>                        
                    <p>
                        In order to smoothly follow the wall (and get an accurate distance measurement) simply treating the wall sensor as a boolean value is insufficient. (This limitation in the RoombaComm library caused us to switch over to managing our own serial communication, giving us full freedom with the sensors.) Instead, we created a variable controller that changes the Create's turning radius depending on the current wall sensor strength, in order to keep it close to the target value. (50 on a scale of 0-200) The turning radius was defined to be a linear interpolation between the maximum finite radius allowed by the Create (2 meters) and 1.75 times the Create's chassis radius, as shown in the graphs below.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Additionally, a method of backing up and rotating was implemented to enable the robot to make sharp left turns. Distance is tracked as the robot moves along, and when a target distance (experimentally measured) is reached, the robot stops.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Results</h1>                        
                    <p>
                        The robot consistently stops in the door frame, successfully reaching its target.
                    </p>  

                    <h1>Potential Improvements</h1>                        
                    <p>
                        Currently, the target distance is from the beginning of the wall near the pillar to the door. Although our method is fairly accurate, errors do accumulate during this time. This could be improved by marking right-angle turns as landmarks as they occur, similarly to what is planned for the next project. If this approach were taken, the distance could be measured from the left turn in the alcove to the center of the door frame. Because this is a much smaller distance, there would be much smaller accumulation of errors.
